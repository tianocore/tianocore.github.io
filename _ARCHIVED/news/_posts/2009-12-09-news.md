The UEFI Open Source Community Website (URL: www.tianocore.org) will be going through some updates and changes.

This site has been using the same format and interfaces since its inception in 2004, and it is time for an update.

These changes will not impact the functionality of the site, and the transition team is focused upon retaining all site content and context as part of the process. The administrators of this site will do everything possible to make the process as smooth and seamless as possible over the next weeks. We apologize if this process causes any difficulty for the membership of the UEFI Open Source Community website.

We will be providing news updates here as the process progresses.

Thank you,

The Administrators
