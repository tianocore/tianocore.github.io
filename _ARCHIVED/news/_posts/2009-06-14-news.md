New On This site!: The official release of the MdePkg version 1.00 and supporting components.

The MdePkg provides developers working on UEFI Applications, UEFI Drivers, UEFI Operating System Loaders, UEFI diagnostics, and UEFI Platform Initialization (PI) compliant silicon modules with a solid UEFI and PI compliant foundation from which to develop their modules under EDK II. This is the first complete version of the MdePkg Package for distribution. This version of this package is a significant milestone in the EDK II development and as other packages reach this level of completeness, we will be providing them on this site as 1.00 releases as well.

For more information, please refer to the EDK II Project home page .
