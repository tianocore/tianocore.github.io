## Add-in Hardware Developers

* See [UEFI Driver Developer Resources with EDK
  II]({{wiki}}/Driver-Developer) Support UEFI driver development by
  independent hardware vendors (IHV), including the UEFI Driver Wizard
  and UEFI Driver Writers Guide (DWG).

* Both [EDK]({{wiki}}/EDK) and [EDK II] contain a Developerâ€™s UEFI
  Emulation ([DuetPkg]({{wiki}}/DuetPkg)) environment to aid in
  development of UEFI drivers for add-in hardware. One of the
  limitations of the [NT32]({{wiki}}/NT32) emulation environment is
  the inability to communicate directly with hardware. This is of
  particular concern to add-in hardware developers (IHVs), who are
  developing UEFI drivers for their hardware devices.
