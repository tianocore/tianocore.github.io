Site Transition – Downtime January 21, 2010 – 

The original hosting for The UEFI Open Source Community Website is now locked down and will be off line soon.  

This is the new hosting site.

The transition team is finishing the moves of the data (files, svn repositories, pages, etc) to this new hosted site.  

You can access the data read only mode as it becomes available.  We are verifying the project and its contents, so it will be a few days before write access becomes available to the site members (including discussion forums).

Please use this time to register with Sourceforge as an user, so we can expedite your access to the projects when write access becomes available on projects.

Questions can be sent directly to the administrators on this site.

Thank you, 


The Administrators
