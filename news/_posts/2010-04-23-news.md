The transition of the UEFI Open Source Community Website to the new hosting (via Sourceforge), has settled down in the past weeks, and for all intents and purposes the move is complete. 

During this time, there have been several new additions to the content on this website.

In the EDK II project, in the subversion repository, there have many updates and new features added to the EDK II code since the first of the year.   

Also, there have been updates to much of the documentation in the EDK II project, including the General Documentation and the addition of a new folder for Technical Information.

This has been an exciting time for the UEFI Open Source Community and this website.  

The administrators would like to thank the members of the community for their understanding and patience during this transition period.
