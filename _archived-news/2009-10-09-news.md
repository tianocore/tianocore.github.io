The "[Getting Started as a Contributor]({{wiki}}/How%20To%20Contribute) " page has been updated with more information defining the term contribution and establishing the difference between participation and Contribution.

These updates have been provided to help establish an understanding of the process of contribution submission, and to encourage more members of the UEFI Open Source Community Website to become contributors to the overall community.
