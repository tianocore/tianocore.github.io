This message is an update on the transition from SourceForge to GitHub for EDK II development.  The schedule is currently targeting the last week of January or the first week of February to perform the transition.  The transition process should only take one to two days to complete.  A notification message will be sent the week prior to the actual dates that the repositories will be impacted.  This should provide adequate notification for the scheduled down time.
As part of this transition some documentation and process changes have been required.  The updated process as well as other GitHub specific information can be found on the tianocore Wiki at the link provided below.  Feedback on this documentation is welcome and needed to make sure the transition is as smooth as possible.

Please post any comments or questions related to this transition to 
the [{{adminemail}}](mailto:{{adminemail}}?Subject=Github%20Question) mailing list.


Thanks, Tianocore.org Administration
