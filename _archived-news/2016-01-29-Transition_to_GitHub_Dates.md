To: EDK II Community


The transition to GitHub will start February 2nd at around 10AM PST (UTC-8). We estimate it to 
be completed by February 4th at 5PM PST.  During this time a number of changes will be happening including 
the disabling of write access to the EDK II repository on SourceForge.  The time that write access is disabled will 
be reduced as much as possible.  A notification will be sent out prior to disabling write access on SourceForge as well 
as a mail when write access is enabled on GitHub.

For status on the transition to GitHub see the Wiki page below.
